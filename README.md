## If Dallphin looks ugly or strange,

If you are using a laptop or an internal or external monitor with Ultra High Definition (4k UHD) using a higher resolution, you might experience the following problems in Dall-Phin.

-	Elements are too small or large compared to the rest of the desktop.
-	Elements such as icons, toolbars, text, and dialog boxes appear to be fuzzy or disoriented.
-	Blurry text appears in Dall-Phin interface.

You can solve these problems by applying one of the following solutions.

1. Change the size of apps: You can right-click on the Desktop (background image) > Display Setting > Change the size of apps, text, and other items on the screen. (100%) (Figure 1A)
2. Change the Java compatibility properties of Javaw.exe: You can find javaw.exe in C:\DAll-Phin\jre\bin in the Explorer and follow these actions: Right click > Properties> Compatibility tab > Change high dpi settings > Click override system settings. (Figure 1B)
